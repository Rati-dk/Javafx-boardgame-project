This is a turn-based game played on a 6x6 board. Players take turns selecting an empty cell and placing their symbol (X or O) in that cell and its neighboring empty cells. When a chosen cell has 4 empty neighboring cells, the player's symbols form a plus (+) shape. The objective is to make the last move and be the player who places the final symbol on the board.
